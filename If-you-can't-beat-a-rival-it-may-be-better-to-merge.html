<span class="first-letter">P</span>eter Thiel started Confinity with his co-founder Max Levchin in 1998. When they released the Paypal product in late 1999. Elon Musk's X.com was right on their heels. X's product mirrored Paypal feature-for-feature. Infact the offices of both companies was four blocks apart on University Avenue in Palo Alto. By late 1999, both were out in war.<br><br>

Many at Paypal logged 100-hour workweeks. No doubt that it was productive, but the focus wasn't on objective productivity, rather the focus was to defeat X.com. <br><br>

But in February 2000, Elon and Peter both were scared about the rapidly inflating tech bubble, a financial crash would ruin them both.<br><br>

So in early March they met in a cafe almost same distance away from their offices and negotiated a 50-50 merger. It killed the rivalry and as a unified team they were able to ride out the dot-com crash and then  build a successful business.
